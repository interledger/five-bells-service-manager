# five-bells-service-manager

> A module to configure and run Five Bells services for testing.

This module does _not_ handle installation of the services ([five-bells-ledger](https://github.com/interledger/five-bells-ledger), [ilp-connector](https://github.com/interledger/js-ilp-connector), etc.).
